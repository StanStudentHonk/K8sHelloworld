# Kubernetes Hello World Project

Welcome to my Kubernetes hello world project, where I apply the skills acquired through tutorials. This project serves as a practical application of the knowledge gained, particularly from the following tutorials:

- [Kubernetes Basics Tutorial](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/)
- [Helm Introduction](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/)

Feel free to explore these tutorials for a comprehensive understanding of Kubernetes fundamentals and Helm usage.
